# calendar-hw-5
Modifying a codebase to create a calendar using moment.js and making it responsive to the current time.

## Description
This application was designed as a convenient work scheduling application by displaying a date in the header, and displaing the current time visually. Each timeblock on the page has the ability to add new events and save them for later, even when leaving the page or upon refresh.
